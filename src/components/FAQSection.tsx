  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I want to cancel my subscription?",
    answer: "You can cancel anytime. Your existing tokens will continue to function normally as they're deployed on the blockchain. You'll retain access to basic management features, but advanced features will be limited based on your new plan."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide token marketing or listing services?",
